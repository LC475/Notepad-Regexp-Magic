1. How can I mark 1 line next to the lines containing a specific word?
Let’s suppose we would like to mark any line containing the license string, as well as the lines just below each line which contains the license string, in the usual license.txt file, part of any N++ package :

    Open the license.txt file in Notepad v.7.5.4

    Open the Mark dialog ( Search > Mark… menu command )

    Check the Bookmark line, Wrap around and Regular expresion options

    Check the Match case option, if necessary

    UN-check the Purge for each search option

    Type in (?-s).*license.*, in the Find what: zone

    Click on the Mark All button

    Type in (?-s)license.*\R\K.*\R, in the Find what: zone

    Click, a second time, on the Mark All button

Et voilà !

Notes :

    As usual, the modifier (?-s) means that any dot character will match a single standard characters, only

    In the first regex, the part .*license.* matches any line containing the string license

    In the second regex, the part license.*\R matches the remaining of the line, beginning with the string license, with its End of Line chars

    Then, the \K syntax forces the regex engine to forget any previous match

    So, the final regex is, simply, .*\R, which matches the entire contents of the next line. Note that the \R syntax, at the end of the regex, which matches the line-break characters, is needed, when this next line is a true blank line !
